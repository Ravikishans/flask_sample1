# Flask Application CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins

This repository contains a simple Flask web application and a Jenkins pipeline setup to automate the testing and deployment process. The goal is to create a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins.

## Project Structure

Here is the structure of the project:

```plaintext
/var/lib/jenkins/workspace/your_job_name/
├── app.py               # Main application code
├── requirements.txt     # Dependencies
├── Jenkinsfile          # Jenkins pipeline definition
├── venv/                # Virtual environment (created locally)
└── tests/               # Test directory
    └── test_example.py  # Example test file
```

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your Jenkins server:

- **Python 3.x**
- **pip** (Python package installer)
- **Jenkins** (with necessary plugins installed)
- **Git** (for cloning repositories)

## Setting Up the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

SSH into your Jenkins server and clone the forked repository:

```bash
cd /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/your_job_name/
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_forked_repo.git
cd your_forked_repo
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

Create and activate a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Create the `tests` Directory

Ensure a `tests` directory exists for storing test files. If it doesn’t exist, create it:

```bash
mkdir tests
```

### 5. Add a Test File

Create a sample test file to verify that `pytest` is working correctly:

```bash
touch tests/test_example.py
```

Add the following code to `tests/test_example.py`:

```python
def test_sample():
    assert 1 + 1 == 2
```

## Jenkins Configuration

### 1. Install Necessary Plugins

Ensure the following Jenkins plugins are installed:

- **Git Plugin**
- **Pipeline Plugin**
- **Email Extension Plugin** (optional for email notifications)

### 2. Configure Email Notifications

Set up email notifications for build successes or failures:

1. Navigate to `Manage Jenkins` > `Configure System`.
2. Scroll to the `Extended E-mail Notification` section.
3. Configure your SMTP server settings.

## Creating the Jenkins Pipeline

### 1. Create a Jenkinsfile

In the root directory of your project, create a `Jenkinsfile` with the following content:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh 'python3 -m venv venv'
                    sh './venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt'
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh './venv/bin/pytest'
                }
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            cleanWs()
        }
        success {
            mail to: 'you@example.com',
                subject: "SUCCESS: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]'",
                body: "The build was successful!"
        }
        failure {
            mail to: 'you@example.com',
                subject: "FAILURE: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]'",
                body: "The build failed. Please check Jenkins for more details."
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Configure GitHub Webhook (Optional)

If you want to trigger builds automatically when you push changes to GitHub:

1. Go to your GitHub repository.
2. Navigate to `Settings` > `Webhooks`.
3. Add a new webhook pointing to `http://your-jenkins-url/github-webhook/`.

## Running the Pipeline

1. **Trigger the Pipeline:**
   - Push your code to the GitHub repository.
   - If configured, this should automatically trigger the Jenkins pipeline.

2. **Manual Trigger:**
   - You can also trigger the pipeline manually from the Jenkins dashboard by selecting "Build Now."

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Pytest Not Found

If you see `-bash: ./venv/bin/pytest: No such file or directory`, it likely means the virtual environment was not set up correctly. Ensure you have followed the steps to create and activate the virtual environment.

### 2. Email Notifications Failing

If email notifications are not sent, verify your SMTP settings in the Jenkins configuration. Check the Jenkins logs for more details.

### 3. Test Collection Issues

If `pytest` reports `collected 0 items`, ensure your test files and functions are named correctly. `pytest` looks for files named `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`.

## Screenshots

Include screenshots of your Jenkins pipeline showing the build, test, and deployment stages here.
